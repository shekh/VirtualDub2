   * New /i (invoke) command line flag runs a script and passes additional parameters to it, which are available as VirtualDub.params[n].
   * Unescaped, native-coded strings can now be embedded in a script using U"..." syntax. In particular, this allows filenames to be inserted directly from a batch file.
   * The Abort button on the dub status dialog now confirms by default for non-preview operations; this can be disabled in Preferences.

   [bugs fixed]
   * "AVIFile compatibility mode" no longer needs to be manually checked in extended AVI options when opening Avisynth scripts.
   * JPEG output mode now properly checks that the output format is set to 16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit RGB.
   * Fixed incompatibilities with some custom UI shells that subclass application windows.

   [features added]
   * Native AMD64 build (see Release Notes for restrictions).
   * New "perspective" video filter can deproject subimages that are displayed obliquely in a scene.
   * YUV formats can now be directly selected for decompression and compression.
   * Planar YUV formats are now supported for both display and output.

   [optimizations]
   * Major optimizations to Resize video filter.
   * SSE2-optimized IDCT kernel.

   [workarounds]
   * Added workaround for codecs that pass decode queries for formats they can't actually decode. VirtualDub will only use these codecs to decode formats with FOURCCs that the codec is registered with, or that the codec naturally produces.
   * Improved workaround for codecs that unmask FPU exceptions in their DLL initialization, particularly FP Divide by Zero (which can cause other codecs to crash).

   [bugs fixed]

   * Fixed crash when changing priority in the middle of render termination.
   * Fixed 3072 sample delay in "center cut" audio filter.

   * Jobs using WAV file audio didn't close the WAV file after completion, keeping it locked across subsequent jobs.
   * Appended file lists were being written out in job scripts in ANSI rather than UTF-8, causing problems with high-plane characters.
   * Audio information in File Information wasn't taking all samples into account.
   * Long paths in the most recently used (MRU) list now ellipsize.
   * Lowered priority of livelock messages to Info so they don't flag as warnings in the job queue.

   * Made 'autodetect additional segments by filename'
     option sticky.
   * Removed trackbar ticks when ticks are a solid bar
     to speed up edits on very long timelines.

     jobs created from entire directories.

   [regressions fixed]
   * Fixed display crashes with odd-width images.
   * Segment loading wasn't hopping across drives to pick
     up segments from a multisegment capture, as directed
     by the AVI's segment hint block.

     or Remote Desktop clients are detected to work around
     a DirectX clipping bug.
   * Re-enabled places bar on open and save dialogs.
   * Disabled FPU state warning and made the fixup silent.
     WAY too many drivers are screwing up the FPU unit.

   * Previous-key and next-key movement commands were not
     correct for B-frames in an MPEG-1 file.
   * Fixed decoding of MPEG-1 B-frames at the start of
     GOPs with broken_link set.
   * Palette change blocks no longer appear as garbage
     video streams.  In-stream palette changes are still
     not supported, however.
   * biSizeImage was incorrect when using fast recompress
     in YV12 mode.
   * Sequence appends failing on the first file now throw
     an error rather than a warning.

Current build (1.5.7, stable):    [October 20, 2003]
   [bugs fixed]
   * Quick preview didn't work if the current position was
     past the number of source frames, even if the timeline
     was longer than that.
   * Added FPU guards that were missing in a couple of
     critical places (AVIFile open, codec negotation).
   * The timeline wasn't properly extended if segments were
     auto-attached by filename after edits had been made.
   * Configuration scripts saved when no file is open
     no longer alter the edit list when loaded.
   * Jobs launched from the command line used the normal
     error modes rather than those set as default by the
     user.

   [regressions fixed]
   * Filter preview buttons weren't updating the frame.
   * Save Image Sequence command would randomly produce
     an unrequested job instead of initiating the render
     directly.
   * Append AVI function was incrementing the filename
     extension instead of the name component.
   * Avisynth scripts smaller than 60 bytes weren't being
     autodetected properly.
   * MP3 audio streams were getting written with
     dwLength=0 if correction was enabled.
   * MPEG decoder occasionally decoded garbage into the
     video frame, resulting in sporadic block errors

     for UYVY and YUY2 modes.
   * Video display updates are now suppressed for panes
     that are totally hidden.

   [bugs fixed]
   * MP3 rate correction was correcting dwRate but not
     interleaving, causing some problems for embedded
     decoders.  The interleaving rate is now adjusted
     on the fly.  Note that MP3 correction is still not
     enabled when segmentation is active.
   * Time base for the position control was improperly
     affected by the "convert to fps" option.
   * "Box blur" filter was broken on CPUs without MMX.

     copying, and saving the log text.
   * Modified AVI2 indexing to relax indexing restrictions
     somewhat, although it's still not user configurable
     yet.

   * Hex editor occasionally displayed the wrong data after
     a find or save command.
   * "Attach extension" option didn't work for signpost
     save dialog.
   * Fixed crash when I/O errors occur during a processing
     operation, and then occur again when attempting to
     gracefully finalize the partial output file.
   * "Clear" didn't work in audio filter graph.
   * Fixed I/O errors when attempting to push audio forward
     with advanced audio filtering enabled.
   * "Go to" command didn't handle timestamps with frac-
     tional seconds that only had 1 or 2 decimal digits.
   * "General convolution" generated bad code for factors
     of 2, 4, and 8 when dynamic compilation was enabled.
   * Interleave periods of zero are no longer allowed.
   * Added workaround for crash or hang when compressing
     with the "3ivx D4 4.0.4" video codec.
   * Fixed non-interleaved save mode and made it cooperate
     with segmentation.
   * Added workaround for heap corruption when processing
     audio in advanced mode sourced from some versions of
     Avisynth.

     to the DivX 4+ codecs.
   * Fixed filter cropping not working properly when
     "motion blur" was the first filter in the chain.

Build 16296 (Version 1.5.4):          [May 28, 2003]
   [features added]

     that was more likely to occur in Windows 95/98.
   * Key frame markers were getting written on some drop
     frames when upsampling the video stream.
   * MPEG code was issuing warnings whenever decode time-
     stamps were more than 0.62s apart; this has been
     fixed to use the actual spec limit of 0.7s.
   * Operation couldn't be aborted while B-frame lag
     frames were being flushed at the end.
   * Fixed a bad error message that displayed a bogus

   [changes]
   * Tweaked job control behavior for jobs that complete

     could cause "Scan for bad frames" to fail.
   * Fixed invalid batch scripts produced when video codec
     has a config struct larger than ~6K (Windows Media 9
     VCM).
   * Status markers were being logged as warnings in jobs.
   * Conversion to a higher frame rate produced amusing
     results in Direct video mode.  It now produces source
     frames interspersed with drop frames for nearly zero-
     cost point upsampling of video.
   * Dubber pretended there was a input-to-output lag if
     such filters existed in the video chain (temporal
     smoother), even if the filters weren't active.  This
     resulting in duplicated frames (fast/normal) or
     erroneous zero-byte keyframes (direct) at the end of
     the output.
   * Arbitrary framerate conversion option wasn't disabled
     in the UI when IVTC was enabled (the two are mutually
     exclusive).

     windows.

   [regression bugs fixed]
   * Fixed pipeline not getting flushed at end of
     operation, resulting in some frames getting lost.
   * Fixed subset code pulling in wrong frames in direct
     mode.
   * Interleaving values were inverted and thus always
     forced one-per-frame.
   * Position slider wasn't updating properly around cuts.

   * Added "new rate" audio filter to relabel an audio
     stream with a new sampling rate without resampling.
   * Incomplete audio format headers that are rejected by
     ACM MP3 codecs are automatically fixed with the
     required fields (the infamous "tag 0055" problem).
   * Added workaround for AVI1 files with MP3 audio being
     detected as MP3 files by Windows Media Player 8.

   [features removed]
   * Removed coach dialogs.  Not helpful enough and too
     outdated to maintain.

   [bug fixes]
   * Fixed capture free space indicator being limited to 4GB
     under Windows 98 (regression in 1.5 series).
   * Fixed crash when job queue could not be flushed to

     highpass audio filters were in use.
   * Fixed internal error when attempting to start an
     incomplete audio filter graph (unconnected pins).

     to audio AVI track headers when converting an MPEG-1
     file.
   * Fixed crash when attempting to load an AVI stream with
     an invalid sample rate (zero or infinite).  Added code
     to guess and substitute a reasonable value.

     circumvent TLS (thread local storage) selector limits.
   * Cropping bounds can now be dragged via the mouse.
   * Improved, friendlier crash diagnostics.
   * Basic audio filter support (no plugin support yet,
     though).  The pitch shifter sucks.
   * Increased accuracy of audio/video timing by switching
     from microsecond to rational calculations.
   * Changed font on dialogs to enable ClearType on XP.

   [features removed]
   * Deleted outdated 3x3 average filter -- it has been
     superceded by "blur."

   [bug fixes]
   * New MPEG audio core (Priss) -- fixes decoding errors
     in layer I and layer III audio and adds SSE polyphase
     support.
   * Fixed motion JPEG decoding bugs when padding is
     present before markers.

     (Regressions in 1.4.12)
   * Fixed audio desynchronization when processing
     compressed audio in direct stream copy mode with both
     a start offset and deleted segments.  Thanks to Cyrius
     for the bug report and fix.
   * Audio compression system now drops a final partial
     block from an audio codec -- Microsoft ADPCM was
     producing these, resulting in a runt AVI stream
     sample. The new behavior matches that of Sound
     Recorder.
   * A partial final block no longer triggers the VBR audio
     adjustment routine.
   * "Previous keyframe" from beyond the end no longer
     seeks to start if frames have been deleted or masked.
     Also thanks to Cyrius.

     caused the directory portion of the dialog to be
     ignored.
   * Fixed broken copyProc support.

     their index if video frames weren't all the same
     size.
   * Fixed some subset-related position slider glitches.
   * RLE AVI files weren't being decompressed correctly
     (GDI's RLE isn't the same as AVI's RLE).
   * Fixed crash disassembler not disassembling some
     instructions properly.
   * Fixed glitches in the first three frames of the
     temporal smoother's output.

     abort-on-right.  (Abort-on-left catches the OK click.)
   * Most-recently-used list on menu now updates correctly
     when file loads fail.

     allows compensation for bad audio clock.
   * Audio conversion dialog now allows arbitrary sampling
     rates (such as 22047).

   [optimizations]

     possible.
   * 'Save striped master' greatly speeds up making audio
     master tracks for using frameservers with the VCM
     driver.
